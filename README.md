There are three modules in this application: presentation, domain and data. In presentation module I've created the user interface and the Application class, introduce dependencies. In that module I had used  MVP, rxjava, dagger2. In domain module I had created all the entities, that I want to use in presentation, made repository interface and usecases. In data module make possible to interaction with local singleton class.
